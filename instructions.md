Can you help me create this simple app? 

Choose which ever language and framework would be the easiest. 

I want to make a very simple app that loads on my mac os at start up. 

It opens up a pop up that overlays on any screen i'm on and gives me a list of short cuts. 

I can search through it to find the list of the short cuts I want to display, and in the code I can create those. 

Perhaps in markdown and it will the pop up overlay that is always on top of all screens on my display will show up and show whatever short cuts I have saved for that particular one.

For instance it could have all my favorite short cuts for vs code.

All my favorite short cuts for mac os notes.

All my favorite short cuts for chrome
